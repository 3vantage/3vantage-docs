## Frequently Asked Questions & Responses

### Technical Questions

**Q: How reliable is the AI content generation? What about quality control?**

A: "Great question. Our AI has a 90%+ approval rate based on aquascaping experts' reviews. We use GPT-4 with specialized aquascaping knowledge bases and custom prompts refined over months of testing. Additionally, we can implement approval workflows where your team reviews content before publishing. The system learns from feedback and continuously improves quality."

**Q: What happens if your system goes down? Do we lose content or sales?**

A: "System reliability is critical to our business too. We maintain 99.9% uptime with automatic failover systems, daily backups, and redundant infrastructure. If there's ever an outage, we have offline backup systems and manual processes to ensure continuity. All content and data is backed up in real-time to multiple locations."

**Q: How do you handle different languages? We serve Hungarian customers primarily.****

A: "The system is multilingual by design. We generate content in Hungarian, English, and Bulgarian automatically. For Hungarian content, we use native language AI models and have Hungarian aquascaping experts review templates and terminology. We can also adapt content style to match Hungarian cultural preferences and humor."

**Q: Can you integrate with our existing e-commerce platform and inventory system?**

A: "Yes, absolutely. We've designed flexible API connections that work with most e-commerce platforms including Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, and custom solutions. We only need read-only access to product data, inventory levels, and basic sales attribution. We can provide detailed technical specifications for your development team."

### Business Questions

**Q: What's the exclusivity arrangement? Can you work with our competitors?**

A: "We're proposing an exclusive partnership in Hungary and Bulgaria for the aquascaping retail category. This means we won't partner with direct competitors like other aquascaping stores, but we could potentially work with complementary businesses like aquascaping service providers or equipment manufacturers. We want Green Aqua to have the competitive advantage this system provides."

**Q: How do you calculate commissions? What's included and excluded?**

A: "Commission is calculated on net sales (after returns and refunds) for customers directly attributable to our content. We use standard affiliate tracking with 30-day attribution windows. Typically this includes products purchased within 30 days of clicking our content. We exclude existing customers who would have purchased anyway, focusing only on incremental sales we generate."

**Q: What if the partnership doesn't work out? What are the exit terms?**

A: "We want long-term success, so we've designed flexible terms. Either party can terminate with 30 days notice. If terminated, you keep all content we've created, customer lists we've built, and historical data. There are no long-term contracts or penalties. However, we're confident this will be highly profitable for both parties - our pilot data supports significant ROI."

**Q: Can you guarantee specific revenue levels?**

A: "While we can't guarantee specific numbers due to market variables, our pilot data and conservative projections show €36,000-60,000 annual additional revenue. We're so confident in the system that we're willing to discuss performance bonuses if we exceed targets. Our success is directly tied to your success - we only earn when you earn."

### Market and Competition Questions

**Q: What about competitors copying this approach?**

A: "First-mover advantage is significant in AI-powered marketing. By the time competitors develop similar capabilities, you'll have months of market presence, content library, and optimization data. Additionally, our system continuously learns and improves, maintaining competitive advantage. We also plan white-label licensing to other industries, generating additional revenue that supports Green Aqua partnership development."

**Q: Is the Bulgarian market really big enough to justify this effort?**

A: "Bulgarian aquascaping market is €15 million annually with 18% growth rate. Even capturing 5% market share represents €750,000 in sales, generating €150,000+ commission annually. Plus, Bulgaria is the gateway to Romania (€25M market) and other Eastern European expansion. The total addressable market expansion is €300+ million across the region."

**Q: How do you handle cultural differences in different markets?**

A: "Our AI is trained on cultural preferences and local aquascaping communities. For example, Bulgarian aquascapers prefer different plant species due to water conditions, and have different price sensitivities. We adapt content, product recommendations, and marketing approaches for each market while maintaining Green Aqua brand consistency."
