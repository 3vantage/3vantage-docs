- **Smart scheduling optimization** based on audience behavior analysis
- **Automated quality control** with multi-stage content validation

### 3. Platform Agnostic Approach
- **Unified content creation** with platform-specific adaptation
- **Extensible architecture** for easy addition of new social media platforms
- **Consistent user experience** across different publishing channels

### 4. Modular Component Design
- **Clear service boundaries** with well-defined interfaces
- **Independent scaling** of different system components
- **Easy testing and maintenance** through separation of concerns

## üîç Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Key architectural decisions and their rationale:

### ADR-001: Local-First Architecture
- **Decision**: Use local storage as primary data store with cloud backup
- **Rationale**: Ensures fast response times, offline capability, and user data control
- **Status**: Accepted and implemented

### ADR-002: Multiple SQLite Databases
- **Decision**: Separate databases for different data types (main, content, cache, analytics)
- **Rationale**: Improves performance, enables independent optimization, simplifies maintenance
- **Status**: Accepted and implemented

### ADR-003: Event-Driven Component Communication
- **Decision**: Use event bus pattern for inter-service communication
- **Rationale**: Enables loose coupling, supports async processing, facilitates scaling
