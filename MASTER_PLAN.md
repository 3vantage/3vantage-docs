   - [3vantage/aquascene](https://github.com/3vantage/aquascene) - Main platform (15 themes)
   - [3vantage/aquascene-waitlist](https://github.com/3vantage/aquascene-waitlist) - Lead generation SPA
   - [3vantage/aquascene-content-engine](https://github.com/3vantage/aquascene-content-engine) - AI content system
   - [3vantage/3vantage-docs](https://github.com/3vantage/3vantage-docs) - Complete documentation

2. **Documentation**: 30+ comprehensive guides and technical documents
3. **Architecture**: Well-designed microservices architecture with Docker infrastructure
4. **Content Templates**: 5 newsletter templates and social media automation code
5. **API Integrations**: Code for Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and email automation

### What Needs Implementation ⚠️
1. **Service Logic**: Most services have placeholder code that needs actual implementation
2. **Database Connections**: Schemas exist but need connection and testing
3. **API Testing**: Integration code exists but hasn't been tested with actual APIs
4. **Production Deployment**: Infrastructure ready but not deployed
5. **End-to-End Testing**: No comprehensive testing has been performed

### Timeline to Production
**Conservative Estimate**: 4-6 weeks of focused development to achieve full functionality
**Optimistic Estimate**: 2-3 weeks for core demo-ready features
